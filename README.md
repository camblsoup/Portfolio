### My Portfolio :)

Hi! I'm Cameron McLagan, a Software Engineer based out of British Columbia, Canada. 

I'm currently a student at Simon Fraser University as of September 20th, 2025 but depending on how persistent I am with updating this I may have already graduated.

This is my personal portfolio to show off some of my web dev skills as well as link to any other projects I'm moderately proud of. You can find a link to the actual website this is a repository for [here](https://camblsoup.github.io/Portfolio/)
